    <p>Tasty hamburger "steaks" smothered in gravy and onions. Serve with hot rice or potatoes for an easy-to-make dinner classic. It's a great way to dress up a pound of ground beef and you probably have all the ingredients on hand!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking sherry</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>STEP 1</em></strong> Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper together in a large bowl until combined. Form into 8 balls and flatten into patties.  </li>
        <li><strong><em>STEP 2</em></strong> Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add patties and onion; fry until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer beef patties to a plate, and keep warm. </li>
        <li><strong><em>STEP 3</em></strong> Sprinkle flour over onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom of the skillet as you stir. Gradually mix in beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat until gravy thickens, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong><em>STEP 4</em></strong> Reduce heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer until cooked through, about 15 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
